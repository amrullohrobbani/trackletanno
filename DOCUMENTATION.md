## Motivation

### Problem Statement
Sports video analysis requires precise annotation of player movements, ball trajectories, and game events across multiple frames. Traditional annotation tools often fall short in providing:

- **Temporal Consistency**: Maintaining tracklet IDs across frames
- **Multi-Sport Support**: Adapting to different sports with unique event systems
- **Efficient Workflow**: Bulk operations for large-scale annotation projects
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Working seamlessly on Windows and Linux systems

### Solution Vision
The Tracklet Annotation Tool addresses these challenges by providing a specialized annotation environment that:

1. **Streamlines Tracklet Management**: Advanced operations for merging, switching, and duplicating tracklets
2. **Supports Multiple Sports**: Tennis and volleyball with extensible event systems
3. **Enhances Productivity**: Batch operations and intelligent auto-detection features
4. **Ensures Data Quality**: Built-in validation and consistency checks

## Review of Available Annotation Tools

### Existing Solutions Analysis

| Tool | Strengths | Limitations | Sport Focus |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **CVAT** | Web-based, multi-user support | Limited sport-specific features | General purpose |
| **LabelImg** | Simple bounding box annotation | No temporal consistency | General purpose |
| **VIA** | Lightweight, web-based | No tracklet management | General purpose |
| **DarkLabel** | Video annotation support | Limited batch operations | General purpose |
| **Supervisely** | Advanced features, cloud-based | Commercial, expensive | General purpose |

### Gap Analysis
- **Lack of Sport-Specific Features**: No tools provide tennis/volleyball-specific event annotation
- **Limited Tracklet Operations**: Basic ID assignment without advanced manipulation
- **Poor Temporal Workflow**: Frame-by-frame annotation without bulk operations
- **No Cross-Platform Desktop**: Most are web-based or platform-specific

### Our Competitive Advantage
- **Sport-Specialized**: Built specifically for tennis and volleyball annotation
- **Advanced Tracklet Management**: Merge, switch, duplicate operations
- **Desktop Performance**: Electron-based for offline work and better performance
- **Researcher-Friendly**: Developed by and for sports analytics researchers
