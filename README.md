## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "This feature is only available in the desktop application"
- **Cause**: Running in web browser mode
- **Solution**: Use `npm run electron-dev` instead of `npm run dev`

#### Images not loading or appearing blank
- **Cause**: File path or permission issues
- **Solutions**:
  - Check that image files are in same folder as annotation file
  - Verify image formats are supported (jpg, jpeg, png, bmp)
  - Ensure file permissions allow reading
  - Try restarting the application

#### "No rally folders found" message
- **Cause**: Directory structure doesn't match expected format
- **Solutions**:
  - Ensure annotation files have `.txt` extension
  - Check that image files are present in rally folders
  - Verify directory naming follows expected pattern
  - Make sure both annotation file and images are in same subfolder

#### Bounding boxes not appearing
- **Cause**: Annotation data format issues or frame mismatch
- **Solutions**:
  - Check CSV format matches expected structure
  - Verify frame numbers in annotations match image filenames
  - Ensure tracklet IDs are within valid range (1-98 for players, 99 for ball)
  - Check that tracklet visibility is enabled (eye icons)

#### Performance issues with large datasets
- **Solutions**:
  - Close unnecessary applications
  - Work with smaller rally folders when possible
  - Restart application periodically for long sessions
  - Ensure sufficient disk space for saving

#### Drawing mode not working
- **Check**:
  - Valid tracklet ID is selected (1-98, not 99 for regular boxes)
  - Drawing mode is actually enabled (check mode indicator)
  - Mouse is being clicked and dragged (not just clicked)
  - Minimum box size requirement (5x5 pixels)

## Tips for Efficient Annotation

### Workflow Optimization
1. **Plan Your Session**: Review video first to understand player movements
2. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Memorize `Z`/`X` for frame navigation and `D`/`A` for modes
3. **Leverage Visibility Controls**: Hide completed tracklets to focus on remaining work
4. **Timeline Feedback**: Use timeline view to track progress and find gaps
5. **Batch Similar Operations**: Do all drawing first, then assignments, then events

### Quality Control
- **Regular Timeline Checks**: Ensure consistent tracklet coverage
- **Event Validation**: Verify event assignments match actual actions
- **Team Assignment**: Double-check team colors match player affiliations
- **Ball Tracking**: Maintain continuous ball annotation throughout rallies

### Performance Tips
- **Work in Segments**: Complete annotation frame-by-frame rather than jumping around
- **Use Zoom Effectively**: Zoom in for precise box placement, zoom out for context
- **Save Frequently**: Though auto-save is enabled, manually verify save status
- **Clean Workspace**: Close unused rallies and restart application for long sessions
