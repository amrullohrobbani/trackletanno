# Tracklet Annotation Tool - Patch Notes

## Version 1.4.1 - Current Release
*Release Date: September 24, 2025*

### üîß Bug Fixes

#### Advanced Tracklet Modal - Duplicate Operation
- **Fixed Frame Index Handling**: Corrected duplicate operation to properly use frame indices instead of literal frame numbers
  - Added `convertFrameIndexToNumber()` helper function for consistent frame index to frame number conversion
  - Updated source frame lookup in `generatePreview`, `performOperation`, and `validateAndStartOperation` functions
  - Enhanced error handling with proper frame index validation
  - Improved UI labels to clarify frame index vs. literal frame number usage

#### User Interface Improvements
- **Updated Input Labels**: 
  - Changed "Source Frame" to "Source Frame Index" for clarity
  - Changed "Target Frame(s)" to "Target Frame Index(es)" for consistency
  - Added helpful placeholder text explaining frame indices vs. literal frame numbers

#### Technical Enhancements
- **Consistent Frame Handling**: Duplicate operation now follows the same frame indexing system as other operations
  - Frame index 1 = first image file, index 2 = second image file, etc.
  - Proper conversion to actual frame numbers from image filenames
  - Updated all dependency arrays to include new helper function

### üéÆ Usage Notes
- When using duplicate operation, enter frame indices (1, 2, 3...) rather than literal frame numbers from filenames
- This ensures consistency with frame range parsing throughout the application

### üéØ New Features

#### Event Management Enhancements
- **Event Delete Functionality**: Added delete button for individual events in Rally Events Modal
  - Delete button (üóëÔ∏è) appears next to each event in the events list
  - Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
  - Deletes only the event annotation, preserves underlying bounding box and tracking data
  - Frame-specific deletion - only removes event from specific frame/tracklet combination
  - Automatic file saving ensures changes are immediately persisted

#### Enhanced User Interface
- **Improved Rally Events Modal**: 
  - Clean layout with event emoji and delete button side by side
  - Red hover highlight for delete button (`hover:text-red-400`)
  - Non-disruptive click handling prevents event navigation when deleting
  - Visual feedback and smooth interactions

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Store Management
- **New Store Function**: `deleteEventFromAnnotation(frame, trackletId)`
  - Removes event property from specific annotation
  - Maintains data integrity by preserving all other annotation properties
  - Console feedback for successful deletions

#### Enhanced Navigation System
- **Buffer Size Optimization**: Confirmed 15-frame buffer for ultra-smooth navigation
  - 15 frames before and after current frame (31 frames total)
  - Smooth rapid Z/X key navigation with 50ms frame timing
  - Animation interruption for responsive consecutive keypresses

### üéÆ Usage Instructions

#### Event Deletion
1. Open Rally Events Modal from left sidebar
2. Locate the event you want to delete
3. Click the üóëÔ∏è delete button next to the event
4. Confirm deletion in the dialog
5. Event is removed while preserving the annotation

#### Navigation
- **Z/X Keys**: Smooth frame-by-frame navigation with animation
- **Home/End Keys**: Instant jumps to first/last frame
- **Rapid Navigation**: Hold or rapidly press Z/X for smooth transitions

### üì¶ Dependencies
- Maintained compatibility with existing codebase
- Uses Heroicons TrashIcon for delete button
- Integrated with existing Zustand store management
