## Version 1.6.1 - Previous Release
*Release Date: October 29, 2025*

### üõ°Ô∏è File Renaming Safety Enhancement

#### Enhanced Safety Logic
- **Conservative File Renaming**: System now only renames files if ALL images have non-digit names
  - Previous: Renamed ALL files if ANY file had non-digit name
  - New: Only renames if ALL files need renaming (safety first approach)
  - Prevents accidental renaming of properly named files

#### Improved Validation & Logging
- **Detailed Logging**: Better visibility into renaming decisions
  - Shows count of digit vs non-digit files
  - Lists examples of non-digit files when preserving original names
  - Clear console messages explaining why files were/weren't renamed

#### Usage Impact
- **Mixed Naming Protection**: If folder has both `001.jpg` and `IMG_001.jpg`, preserves all original names
- **Batch Renaming**: Only when folder has files like `IMG_001.jpg`, `photo_002.jpg` (all non-digit)
- **Data Safety**: Prevents loss of carefully crafted filename conventions

  - Updated source frame lookup in `generatePreview`, `performOperation`, and `validateAndStartOperation` functions
  - Enhanced error handling with proper frame index validation
  - Improved UI labels to clarify frame index vs. literal frame number usage

  - Updated all dependency arrays to include new helper function

### üéÆ Usage Notes
- When using duplicate operation, enter frame indices (1, 2, 3...) rather than literal frame numbers from filenames
- This ensures consistency with frame range parsing throughout the application
